Musicoin core
===============

To get setup, run `npm install`

Currently, this package assumes IPFS, Geth/Parity, and MongoDB are already running.  

Start the repo using: `node rest-api/app.js --ipfsHost http://localhost:8080 --web3Host http://localhost:8545`

Contains only critical functionality. Rest of the stuff is available in the Musicoin API repository.
